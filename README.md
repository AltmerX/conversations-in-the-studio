## Course Objectives

*	To help students understand the value and means of real-world, practical impact. This topic can be understood commercially, societally, and personally.

*	To broadly expose students to varying forms of impact, from commercial success to societal good, from engineering to art, from the pure tech sector to the information economy transforming all sectors, from startups to growth opportunities on and at any stage.

*	To give students first-hand contact with entrepreneurial individuals that can serve as role models and connectors.

*	To help students develop personal models of impact that will motivate and aid their own entrepreneurial lives after graduation.

*	To give students experience moderating thoughtful conversations with diverse leaders on behalf of the Cornell Tech community.

## Student Responsibilities

*	Each week a randomly assigned group of students is responsible for moderating the conversation. This includes researching the guest and topic beforehand, coming prepared with [questions and discussion points](https://github.com/cornelltech/conversations-in-the-studio/wiki/Questions), welcoming and introducing the guest, and leading the group conversation.

*	Students must proactively engage the guests and each other, asking attentive questions and making follow-up comments.

*	At the end of each practicum, both the moderating students and several students in the audience volunteer or are called upon to share their personal takeaways in front of the guest.

*	In the final week, students come prepared to share their personal takeaways from the entire semester, to be discussed as a group and with the guest.
